## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine.
-   A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up).
-   `wrangler` CLI, which can be installed with `bun install -g wrangler`.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/acadia-lms.git
    cd acadia-lms
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.dev.vars` file in the root of the project for local development. You can copy the example from `wrangler.jsonc`:

    ```ini
    CF_AI_BASE_URL="https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/YOUR_GATEWAY_ID/openai"
    CF_AI_API_KEY="your-cloudflare-api-key"
    ```

    Replace the placeholder values with your actual Cloudflare Account ID, AI Gateway ID, and API Key.

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, which includes the Vite frontend and the local `wrangler` dev server, run:

```sh
bun dev
```

This will start the application, typically available at `http://localhost:3000`. The frontend will hot-reload on changes, and the worker backend will restart automatically.

## üö¢ Deployment

This project is designed for seamless deployment to Cloudflare's global network.

1.  **Login to Wrangler:**
    If you haven't already, authenticate `wrangler` with your Cloudflare account:
    ```sh
    bunx wrangler login
    ```

2.  **Configure Production Secrets:**
    Set your production environment variables as secrets for your worker:
    ```sh
    bunx wrangler secret put CF_AI_BASE_URL
    bunx wrangler secret put CF_AI_API_KEY
    ```

3.  **Deploy the application:**
    Run the deploy script to build the application and deploy it to Cloudflare Pages:
    ```sh
    bun deploy
    ```

Alternatively, you can deploy directly from your GitHub repository using the button below.
